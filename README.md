Live Art consisting of randomly selected characters and spaces. 

Taking inspiration from the 'infinite Monkey Theorem', This piece, given an infinite amount of time will have completed every past, present and future written work in the English language, raising the questions of human limitation through reading and curating in a textual format.

What limitations does the text have for us as readers? Whilst what does finely crafted literature transform the stage in our mind? Playing with the ideas of the theme 'new ways of READING', 
We invite the voyeur to read between lines and digest the non-visible information, and creative intent interweaved beyond the text itself.


We are developing ways to immortalise this project by making it durationally infinite, creating permanence. With the intention for this project to complete every possible work to be and ever be, it will transcend into an Omni-textual work. Whether this be online, streamed for further viewing, or left with a sustainable supply to completed offline are all things considered for future developments.
